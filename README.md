LD-Net: A Lightweight Network for Real-Time
Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation

Self-supervised monocular depth estimation from video sequences is promising for 3D environments perception.
However, most existing methods use complicated depth networks
to realize monocular depth estimation, which are often difficultly
applied to resource-constrained devices. To solve this problem, in
this letter, we propose a novel encoder-decoder-based lightweight
depth network (LD-Net).
